Hellurei, my friends. It's Pekkis here.

I promised to send preparation instructions for the React training ~a week in advance, so here we are.

It is very important to follow these instructions _before_ the training day so we don't lose time on pre-setup.

Start by joining the Discord (link below) server. In the past couple of trainings people had random issues with the web version, so I recommend using the desktop version of the software.

https://discord.gg/<xxxxxx> (This link should be alive for 7 days)

After you have joined, you can clone / fork the repo and set the coding environment up.

Follow the instructions carefully. Make sure you got the site up and running BEFORE THE TRAINING SESSION. Also make sure that you start LiveShare in VSCode once (it requires logging in at the first startup). If you encounter errors, holler at the Discord.

If you want to use some other IDE / editor than VSCode, you'll miss out on LiveShare and that is a useful tool here. So maybe you really oughta use VSCode this time even if you like the usual IDE better.

See you at the server, and hey, you should absolutely pull the latest chances in the morning before the session and run `npm install`. I'm pretty sure I'll still update the repo somehow with something, update the packages and / or apply some latest wizardry.

We'll start both days at 0900 hours and end at ~1600ish hours.

Cheers,

Pekkis

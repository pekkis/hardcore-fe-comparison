# Pekkis' Hardcore Frontend Comparison

Comparing React with it's sane and realistic alternatives by implementing my React training app in each of them.

## Howto

There's a branch for every framework I use here:

- `react` (the original app)
- `svelte` (svelte conversion)
- `vue` (vue conversion, vue v3)

### Develop

- `npm install`
- `cp .env.example .env`
- `npm run start`

Open browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (if that is reserved for some reason, you might get another port but the terminal should tell you that).

### Build

- `npm run build`

Look at the `dist/`

## Licensing
